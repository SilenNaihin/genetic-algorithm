        "1. **Gradient-free optimization** is necessary when:\n",
        "   - The loss function is non-differentiable\n",
        "   - Rewards are sparse\n",
        "   - The system has a black-box component (physics engine)\n",

        "2. **Genetic algorithms** provide a population-based search:\n",
        "   - Selection: survival of the fittest\n",
        "   - Crossover: combining good solutions\n",
        "   - Mutation: exploring nearby solutions\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Neuroevolution** treats neural network weights as a genome:\n",
        "   - Flatten weights into a vector\n",
        "   - Apply GA operators\n",
        "   - Evaluate by running the network\n",

        "4. **NEAT** evolves network topology:\n",
        "   - Historical markings enable crossover\n",
        "   - Speciation protects innovation\n",

        "5. **Evolution Lab** uses these concepts:\n",
        "   - Oscillators: simple, fast to evolve\n",
